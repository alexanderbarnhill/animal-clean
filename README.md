# ANIMAL-CLEAN
An animal-independent deep denoising, segmentation, and classification toolkit



# Setup
## Location
Due to potential differences in directory configurations when training on a computing cluster or locally and the desire to keep those settings different, there are two `location` parameters used here.
- `local`
- `cluster`

**ANIMAL--CLEAN automatically looks for the `SLURM_JOB_ID` environment variable to determine if the script is being run in slurm. In this case, the `cluster` settings are used.**
## Species Configuration

The species [configurations](configuration/species) are available for
- [Pygmy pipistrelle](configuration/species/bat.yaml)
- [Chimpanzee](configuration/species/chimp.yaml)
- [Atlantic Cod](configuration/species/cod.yaml)
- [Killer Whale](configuration/species/orca.yaml)
- [Monk Parakeet](configuration/species/parakeet.yaml)
- [Primate](configuration/species/primate.yaml)
- [Warbler](configuration/species/warbler.yaml)

## Training
Data settings are controlled with the `species` settings (see above).

## Prediction
